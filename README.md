## How your code will be deployed?

To host your bot and deploy your code, create a repository on Github, and push this code on it.
Connect your github account on Recast:

- Go to your bot page
- Click on the **RUN** tab, and on the **Bot Hosting** menu
- Connect your Github account
- Select the repository you've just created
- Wait a little, we're starting your instance...

Every time you will push onto the master branch, we'll deploy your code üëè

#### Requirements

Since we deploy your code in generic containers, there are 3 requirements:

- [x] Your package.json **must** contain the `build` task. It must be present even if empty or just copying files. The default one you will find in the starter kit is `"build": "babel src -d lib"` to compile your Javascript. So you can code with your favorite ES6, ES7 features :thumbsup:
- [x] A lib directory must be present (by default it's created with the `build` task)
- [x] The entrypoint of your code in production **must** be in the `lib/bot.js` file. This file **must** contain an export of a `bot` function named `bot`. It takes as the first argument the body of the request (Bot Connector, custom curl,...)

You can change all other file names, directory structures, but be sure that these three points work fine!

You can add any env. variable you want in the **Bot Hosting** section and then use it in your code with this syntax: `process.env.MY_ENV_VAR_NAME`
